# Digit Recognizer
This is an implementation of a convolutional neural network for recognizing hand written digits using the MNIST dataset. A validation accuracy of about 99.3% is obtained after training for 11 epochs. 

Here is an example of an output generated by display_random.py.

## Requirements

* Python 2.7
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* h5py
* numpy
* matplotlib
* pandas

## Dataset

* The model is trained on the MNIST dataset downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). 

* The file train.csv contains the labels and pixel intensity values for 42000 images. The pixel intensity values are integers between 0 and 255 which are converted to float by dividing by 255.0 during preprocessing.

* test.csv contains pixel intensity values for 28000 images.

* The predictions for each image in test.csv are written in predictions.csv for submission at Kaggle.
