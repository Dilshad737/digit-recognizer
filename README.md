# digit-recognizer
We train a convolutional neural network to recognize hand written digits using the MNIST data set and the Keras library. The model is trained with batches of 50 images for 11 epochs. A validation accuracy of about 99.3% is obtained. 

Here is an example of an output generated by display_random.py.
