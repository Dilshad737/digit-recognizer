# digit-recognizer
This is an implementation of a convolutional neural network for recognizing hand written digits using the MNIST dataset. A validation accuracy of about **99.3%** is obtained after training for 11 epochs. 

* **train.py** trains the CNN for 1 epoch and saves the model and weights.
* **test.py** predicts the outputs for the test set and saves the results in **predictions.csv**.
* **display_random.py** randomly selects 25 images from the test set and displays them with their predicted outputs.

Here is an example of an output generated by **display_random.py**.
